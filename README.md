### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

Whoa! You've stumbled upon my github profile! Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜„

## Who am I?
My name is **William Qi**, and I'm a senior at Mother Margaret Mary High School. I've been recently working with **Java** after having experimented with and creating projects with **Node.js** the past few years. Currently, I'm volunteering for [@MoonCraft-Games](https://github.com/Mooncraft-Games) as a Java Software Developer.
Outside of programming, I love playing Minecraft and StarCraft II, I enjoy the creative and strategic aspects of both games!

## Contact
You can reach me by [email](mailto:williamqi.250@gmail.com) or via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wq1/).
Thanks for stopping by and I look forward to seeing you again!
